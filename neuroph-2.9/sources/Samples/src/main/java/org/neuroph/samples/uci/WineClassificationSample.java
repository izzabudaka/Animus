DATA SET INFORMATION:

These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. 

I think that the initial data set had around 30 variables, but for some reason I only have the 13 dimensional version. I had a list of what the 30 or so variables were, but a.) I lost it, and b.), I would not know which 13 variables are included in the set. 

The Input Variables are:
1) Alcohol 
2) Malic acid 
3) Ash 
4) Alcalinity of ash 
5) Magnesium 
6) Total phenols 
7) Flavanoids 
8) Nonflavanoid phenols 
9) Proanthocyanins 
10)Color intensity 
11)Hue 
12)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines 
13)Proline 

In a classification context, this is a well posed problem with "well behaved" class structures. A good data set for first testing of a new classifier, but not very challenging.

Output Variable is type of wine (nominal value).

ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION:

All attributes are continuous 

No statistics available, but suggest to standardise variables for certain uses (e.g. for us with classifiers which are NOT scale invariant) 
 
 The original data set that will be used in this experiment can be found at link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine
