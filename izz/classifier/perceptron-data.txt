they backed toward the door nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them and a minute later were hurrying 
5
back up the passageway full of black candles pudding might not be finished yet said ron hopefully leading the way 
5
anything here the babble of talk from the halloween feast was echoing out of the great hall harry sprinted up 
5
the marble staircase to the first floor ron and hermione clattering behind him harry whatre we - shh 138 harry 
5
- harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor ron and hermione panting behind him not stopping until they 
5
turned a corner into the last deserted passage harry what was that all about said ron wiping sweat off his 
5
face i couldnt hear anything but hermione gave a sudden gasp pointing down the corridor look something was shining on 
5
told them that the feast had just ended from either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound 
5
of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs and the loud happy talk of well-fed people; next moment students were crashing 
5
eyes alive his usually bloodless face flushed as he grinned at the sight of the hanging immobile cat ince the 
2
disastrous episode of the pixies professor lockhart had not brought live creatures to class instead he read passages from his 
2
books to them and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits he usually picked harry to help him with 
5
these reconstructions; so far harry had been forced to play a simple transylvanian villager whom lockhart had cured of a 
3
babbling curse a yeti with a head cold and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce 
3
since lockhart had dealt with him harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next defense 
3
against the dark arts lesson this time acting a werewolf if he hadnt had a very good reason for keeping 
3
lockhart in a good mood he would have refused to do it nice loud howl harry - exactly - and 
3
then if youll believe it i pounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one 
3
hand i managed to hold him down - with my other i *161* put my wand to his throat -i 
2
then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex homorphus charm - he let out a piteous moan 
3
- go on harry - higher than that - good - the fur vanished - the fangs shrank - and 
3
he turned back into a man simple yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the hero 
3
who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks the bell rang and lockhart got to his feet homework 
2
- compose a poem about my defeat of the wagga wagga werewolf signed copies of magical me to the author 
3
of the best one the class began to leave harry returned to the back of the room where ron and 
5
hermione were waiting a haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene both neville and justin were lying on 
5
the floor panting; ron was holding up an ashen-faced seamus apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but hermione 
5
and millicent bulstrode were still moving; millicent had hermione in a headlock and hermione was whimpering in pain; both their 
4
wands lay forgotten on the floor harry leapt forward and pulled millicent off it was difficult: she was a lot 
5
bigger than he was dear dear said lockhart skittering through the crowd looking at the aftermath of the duels up 
5
you go macmillan *192* careful there miss fawcett pinch it hard itll stop bleeding in a second boot i think 
3
id better teach you how to block unfriendly spells said lockhart standing flustered in the midst of the hall he 
3
glanced at snape whose black eyes glinted and looked quickly away lets have a volunteer pair - longbottom and finch-fletchley 
5
how about you - a bad idea professor lockhart said snape gliding over like a large and malevolent bat longbottom 
3
causes devastation with the simplest spells well be sending whats left of finch-fletchley up to the hospital wing in a 
3
attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action and dropped it snape smirked as lockhart quickly picked it up saying whoops 
1
-my wand is a little overexcited - snape moved closer to malfoy bent down and whispered something in his ear 
1
malfoy smirked too harry looked up nervously at lockhart and said professor could you show me that blocking thing again 
1
scared muttered malfoy so that lockhart couldnt hear him you wish said harry out of the corner of his mouth 
1
lockhart cuffed harry merrily on the shoulder just do what i did harry what drop my wand but lockhart wasnt 
1
listening three - two - one - go he shouted malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed serpensortia the end 
1
of his wand exploded harry watched aghast as a long black snake shot out of it fell heavily onto the 
1
floor between them and raised itself ready to strike there were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away clearing the 
1
floor dont move potter said snape lazily clearly enjoying the sight of harry standing motionless eye to eye with the 
1
angry snake ill get rid of it allow me shouted lockhart he brandished his wand at the snake and there 
1
was a loud bang; the snake instead of vanishing flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the 
3
floor with a loud smack enraged hissing furiously it slithered straight toward justin finch-fletchley and raised itself again fangs exposed 
1
poised to strike harry wasnt sure what made him do it he wasnt even aware of deciding to do it 
1
all he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he 
1
had shouted stupidly at the snake leave him alone and miraculously - inexplicably - the snake slumped to the floor 
1
docile as a thick black garden hose its eyes now on harry harry felt the fear drain out of him 
1
he knew the snake wouldnt attack anyone now though how he knew it he couldnt have explained he looked up 
5
at justin grinning expecting to see justin looking *194* relieved or puzzled or even grateful - but certainly not angry 
5
and scared what do you think youre playing at he shouted and before harry could say anything justin had turned 
5
and stormed out of the hall snape stepped forward waved his wand and the snake vanished in a small puff 
5
on - ron steered him out of the hall hermione hurrying alongside them as they went through the doors the 
5
people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something harry didnt have a clue what 
5
was going on and neither ron nor hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to 
5
the empty gryffindor common room then ron pushed harry into an armchair and said youre a parselmouth why didnt you 
2
tell us im a what said harry a parselmouth said ron you can talk to snakes i know said harry 
2
i mean thats only the second time ive ever done it i accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin 
2
dudley at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen brazil and 
5
i sort of set it free without meaning to that was before i knew i was a wizard - a 
5
boa constrictor told you it had never seen brazil ron repeated faintly peeves stopped halfway through a midair somersault upside 
5
down he spotted justin and nearly headless nick he flipped the right way up filled his lungs and before harry 
5
great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars as harry trembled ready to close his eyes if it turned 
1
he saw what had distracted the snake fawkes was soaring around its head and the basilisk was snapping furiously at 
1
him with fangs long and thin as sabers fawkes dived his long golden beak sank out of sight and a 
1
song jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes help me help 
1
me harry muttered wildly someone - anyone the snakes tail whipped across the floor again harry ducked something soft hit 
1
his face the basilisk had swept the sorting hat into harrys arms harry seized it it was all he had 
1
left his only chance - he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the 
1
basilisks tail swung over him again help me - help me - harry thought his eyes screwed tight under the 
1
hat please help me there was no answering voice instead the hat contracted as though an invisible hand was squeezing 
1
it very tightly something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of harrys head almost knocking him out stars 
1
winking in front of his eyes he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something 
1
long and hard beneath it 3 19 a gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat its handle glittering with 
1
rubies the size of eggs kill the boy leave the bird the boy is behind you sniff -- smell him 
1
harry was on his feet ready the basilisks head was falling its body coiling around hitting pillars as it twisted 
1
to face him he could see the vast bloody eye sockets see the mouth stretching wide wide enough to swallow 
1
him whole lined with fangs long as his sword thin glittering venomous - it lunged blindly -- harry dodged and 
1
it hit the chamber wall it lunged again and its forked tongue lashed harrys side he raised the sword in 
1
both his hands - the basilisk lunged again and this time its aim was true -- harry threw his whole 
1
weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpents mouth - but as 
1
warm blood drenched harrys arms he felt a searing pain just above his elbow one long poisonous fang was sinking 
1
deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell twitching to the 
1
floor harry slid down the wall he gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it 
1
out of his arm but he knew it was too late white-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the 
1
wound even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes his vision went foggy the 
1
chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color a patch of scarlet swam past and harry heard a soft 
4
clatter of claws beside him fawkes said harry thickly you were fantastic fawkes 1520 he felt the bird lay its 
4
beautiful head on the spot where the serpents fang had pierced him he could hear echoing footsteps and then a 
4
dark shadow moved in front of him youre dead harry potter said riddles voice above him dead even dumbledores bird 
4
knows it do you see what hes doing potter hes crying harry blinked fawkes head slid in and out of 
4
focus thick pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers im going to sit here and watch you die harry 
4
potter take your time im in no hurry harry felt drowsy everything around him seemed to be spinning so ends 
4
the famous harry potter said riddles distant voice alone in the chamber of secrets forsaken by his friends defeated at 
4
last by the dark lord he so unwisely challenged youll be back with your dear mudblood mother soon harry she 
4
bought you twelve years of borrowed time but lord voldemort got you in the end as you knew he must 
4
if this is dying thought harry its not so bad even the pain was leaving him but was this dying 
4
instead of going black the chamber seemed to be coming back into focus harry gave his head a little shake 
4
and there was fawkes still resting his head on harrys arm a pearly patch of tears was shining all around 
4
the wound -- except that there was no wound get away bird said riddles voice suddenly get away from him 
1
- i said get away -- harry raised his head riddle was pointing harrys wand at fawkes; there was a 
1
bang like a gun and fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet phoenix tears - said 
1
riddle quietly staring at harrys arm of course healing powers i forgot he looked into harrys face but it makes 
1
no difference in fact i prefer it this way just you and me harry potter you and me he raised 
1
the wand then in a rush of wings fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into harrys lap -- 
1
the diary for a split second both harry and riddle wand still raised stared at it then without thinking without 
1
considering as though he had meant to do it all along harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next 
1
to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book there was a long dreadful piercing scream ink 
1
spurted out of the diary in torrents streaming over harrys hands flooding the floor riddle was writhing and twisting screaming 
1
and flailing and then he had gone harrys wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence 
1
sizzling hole right through it shaking all over harry pulled himself up his head was spinning as though hed just 
1
traveled miles by floo powder slowly he gathered together his wand and the sorting hat and with a huge tug 
1
retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisks mouth then came a faint moan from the end of 
1
the chamber ginny was stirring as harry hurried toward her she sat up her bemused 1522 eyes traveled from the 
4
huge form of the dead basilisk over harry in his blood-soaked robes then to the diary in his hand she 
4
drew a great shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face harry -- oh harry -- i tried 
4
to tell you at b-breakfast but i c-couldnt say it in front of percy -- it was me harry -- 
4
but i -- i s-swear i d- diddt mean to -- r-riddle made me he t-took me over -- and 
4
- how did you kill that -- that thing w-wheres riddle the last thing i r- remember is him coming 
4
out of the diary -- its all right said harry holding up the diary and showing ginny the fang hole 
4
riddles finished look him and the basilisk cmon ginny lets get out of here -- im going to be expelled 
4
ginny wept as harry helped her awkwardly to her feet ive looked forward to coming to hogwarts ever since b-bill 
4
came and n-now ill have to leave and -- w-whatll mum and dad say fawkes was waiting for them hovering 
4
in the chamber entrance harry urged ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk through the 
4
echoing gloom and back into the tunnel harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss after 
4
a few minutes progress up the dark tunnel a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached harrys ears ron harry
